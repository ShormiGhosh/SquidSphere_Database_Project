### ‚úÖ Lab 04: DML (Data Manipulation)
**Location**: Throughout all PHP files

1. **INSERT**
   ```sql
   -- Insert single player
   INSERT INTO players (player_number, name, age, gender, nationality, debt, status) 
   VALUES ('001', 'Seong Gi-hun', 47, 'Male', 'Korean', 255000000, 'alive');
   
   -- Insert staff with hierarchy
   INSERT INTO staff (staff_id, name, role, rank, supervisor_id, salary) 
   VALUES (1, 'Front Man', 'frontman', 1, NULL, 10000000);
   ```

2. **UPDATE**
   ```sql
   -- Update player status
   UPDATE players SET status = 'eliminated' WHERE player_id = 123;
   
   -- Update multiple fields
   UPDATE players SET age = 48, debt = 300000000 WHERE player_number = '001';
   ```

3. **DELETE**
   ```sql
   -- Delete single player
   DELETE FROM players WHERE player_id = 456;
   
   -- Delete with condition
   DELETE FROM players WHERE status = 'eliminated' AND age < 20;
   ```

4. **SELECT**
   ```sql
   -- Basic select
   SELECT * FROM players;
   
   -- With conditions
   SELECT name, age, debt FROM players WHERE status = 'alive';
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ Lab 05: Subqueries & Set Operations
**Location**: `api/search_players.php`, `search.php`

#### Subqueries

1. **Simple Subquery with IN**
   ```sql
   -- Players with above average debt
   SELECT * FROM players 
   WHERE player_id IN (
       SELECT player_id FROM players 
       WHERE debt > (SELECT AVG(debt) FROM players)
   );
   ```

2. **Subquery with NOT IN**
   ```sql
   -- Exclude rare nationalities
   SELECT * FROM players 
   WHERE nationality NOT IN (
       SELECT nationality FROM players 
       GROUP BY nationality 
       HAVING COUNT(*) < 5
   );
   ```

3. **Nested Subquery (2+ levels)**
   ```sql
   -- Players with maximum debt
   SELECT * FROM players 
   WHERE debt = (
       SELECT MAX(debt) FROM players 
       WHERE player_id IN (SELECT player_id FROM players)
   );
   ```

4. **Correlated Subquery with EXISTS**
   ```sql
   -- Players with similar debt to others
   SELECT p1.* FROM players p1 
   WHERE EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM players p2 
       WHERE p2.player_id != p1.player_id 
         AND p2.debt BETWEEN p1.debt - 5000000 AND p1.debt + 5000000
   );
   ```

5. **Subquery with Aggregate Functions**
   ```sql
   -- Players older than average
   SELECT * FROM players 
   WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM players);
   ```

#### Set Operations

6. **UNION**
   ```sql
   -- Males OR High debt females
   (SELECT * FROM players WHERE gender = 'Male')
   UNION
   (SELECT * FROM players WHERE gender = 'Female' AND debt > 50000000);
   ```

7. **INTERSECT (Simulated)**
   ```sql
   -- Young AND Low debt
   SELECT * FROM players 
   WHERE player_id IN (SELECT player_id FROM players WHERE age < 30)
     AND player_id IN (SELECT player_id FROM players WHERE debt < 10000000);
   ```

8. **MINUS/EXCEPT (Simulated)**
   ```sql
   -- Alive but NOT young
   SELECT * FROM players 
   WHERE status = 'alive' 
     AND player_id NOT IN (SELECT player_id FROM players WHERE age < 25);
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ Lab 06: JOINS
**Location**: `staff_visual.php`, `staff.php`, `staff_assignments.php`

1. **SELF JOIN**
   ```sql
   -- Staff hierarchy with supervisor names
   SELECT s1.staff_id, s1.name, s1.role, s1.rank,
          s2.name AS supervisor_name, s2.role AS supervisor_role
   FROM staff s1
   LEFT JOIN staff s2 ON s1.supervisor_id = s2.staff_id
   ORDER BY s1.rank ASC;
   ```

2. **INNER JOIN (2 tables)**
   ```sql
   -- Staff with their assignments
   SELECT s.name, s.role, g.game_name, sa.assignment_date
   FROM staff_assignments sa
   INNER JOIN staff s ON sa.staff_id = s.staff_id
   INNER JOIN games g ON sa.game_id = g.game_id;
   ```

3. **INNER JOIN (3 tables)**
   ```sql
   -- Complete assignment details
   SELECT s.name AS staff_name, s.role, 
          g.game_name, g.round_number,
          sa.assignment_date
   FROM staff_assignments sa
   INNER JOIN staff s ON sa.staff_id = s.staff_id
   INNER JOIN games g ON sa.game_id = g.game_id
   ORDER BY g.round_number, s.role;
   ```

4. **LEFT JOIN**
   ```sql
   -- All staff including those without supervisors
   SELECT s1.name, s2.name AS supervisor
   FROM staff s1
   LEFT JOIN staff s2 ON s1.supervisor_id = s2.staff_id;
   ```
