---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Basic Search Filters
- ✅ Player Number (LIKE pattern matching)
- ✅ Name (LIKE pattern matching)
- ✅ Gender (exact match)
- ✅ Age Range (min/max)
- ✅ Nationality (LIKE pattern matching)
- ✅ Debt Range (min/max)
- ✅ Status (alive/eliminated)

### 2. Advanced SQL Queries

#### Subqueries (IN, NOT IN)
- ✅ Players with debt ABOVE AVERAGE
- ✅ Players with debt BELOW AVERAGE
- ✅ Players OLDER than average
- ✅ Players YOUNGER than average

#### Nested Subqueries
- ✅ Players with MAXIMUM debt (2-level nested)
- ✅ Players with MINIMUM debt (2-level nested)

#### Set Operations
- ✅ **UNION**: Males OR High Debt Females (>50M)
- ✅ **INTERSECT** (simulated): Young (<30) AND Low Debt (<10M)
- ✅ **MINUS** (simulated): Alive but NOT Young (<25)

#### Complex Conditions
- ✅ **IN**: Top 3 Nationalities (Most Players)
- ✅ **NOT IN**: Exclude Rare Nationalities (<5 Players)
- ✅ **EXISTS**: Players with Similar Debt (±5M) - Correlated subquery

### 3. Additional SQL Features
- ✅ **DISTINCT**: Remove duplicate results
- ✅ **LIKE**: Pattern matching with % wildcard
- ✅ **ORDER BY**: Multiple sort options (ASC/DESC)
- ✅ **LIMIT**: Restrict number of results
- ✅ **Aggregate Functions**: AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), COUNT()
- ✅ **GROUP BY**: Group data for set operations
- ✅ **HAVING**: Filter grouped results
- ✅ **BETWEEN**: Range queries

## 🔧 Backend Architecture

### API: search_players.php
```php
Functions:
- buildAdvancedQuery() - Routes to appropriate SQL query
- buildBaseQuery() - Constructs base SELECT with filters
- buildWhereConditions() - Builds WHERE clause dynamically
```

### Query Types Supported:
1. **Basic Filters**: Simple WHERE conditions
2. **Subquery Filters**: IN with SELECT
3. **Nested Subqueries**: Multiple levels of SELECT
4. **Set Operations**: UNION, INTERSECT simulation, MINUS simulation
5. **Correlated Subqueries**: EXISTS with table aliases

## 📝 Example SQL Queries Generated

### Example 1: Above Average Debt
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players 
WHERE player_id IN (
    SELECT player_id FROM players 
    WHERE debt > (SELECT AVG(debt) FROM players)
)
ORDER BY debt DESC 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Example 2: UNION - Males OR High Debt Females
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    (SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players WHERE gender = 'Male')
    UNION
    (SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players WHERE gender = 'Female' AND debt > 50000000)
) AS union_result 
ORDER BY player_number ASC 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Example 3: EXISTS - Similar Debt
```sql
SELECT p1.* FROM players p1 
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM players p2 
    WHERE p2.player_id != p1.player_id 
      AND p2.debt BETWEEN p1.debt - 5000000 AND p1.debt + 5000000
)
ORDER BY debt ASC 
LIMIT 100;
```
