# Search Feature - Database Schema Fixes

## ‚úÖ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED!

### Problem: "0 players showing" in search results

---

## üîç Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Wrong Column Name: `debt` vs `debt_amount`**
**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
    debt_amount DECIMAL(15,2)  -- Actual column name
);
```

**API was using**: `debt` (incorrect)  
**Fixed to**: `debt_amount` (correct)

### 2. **Wrong Gender Values: `'Male'/'Female'` vs `'M'/'F'`**
**Database Schema**:
```sql
gender ENUM('M', 'F', 'Other')  -- Actual values
```

**API was using**: `'Male'`, `'Female'` (incorrect)  
**Fixed to**: `'M'`, `'F'`, `'Other'` (correct)

---

## üîß Files Fixed

### 1. `api/search_players.php` - Backend SQL Queries

#### Changes Made:
‚úÖ Replaced all `debt` with `debt_amount` (28 occurrences)  
‚úÖ Changed `gender = 'Male'` to `gender = 'M'`  
‚úÖ Changed `gender = 'Female'` to `gender = 'F'`  

#### Affected Queries:
- STATUS-BASED: Alive with high debt
- UNION: Alive rich OR Eliminated young  
- SUBQUERY: Above/Below average debt
- NESTED SUBQUERY: Maximum/Minimum debt
- UNION: Males OR High debt females
- INTERSECT: Young AND Low debt
- EXISTS: Players with similar debt
- Debt range filters (WHERE conditions)

### 2. `search.php` - Frontend UI

#### Changes Made:
‚úÖ Updated Gender dropdown:
```html
<option value="M">Male</option>
<option value="F">Female</option>
<option value="Other">Other</option>
```

‚úÖ Updated Sort By dropdown:
```html
<option value="debt_amount ASC">Debt (Lowest First)</option>
<option value="debt_amount DESC">Debt (Highest First)</option>
```

### 3. `search.js` - JavaScript Display Logic

#### Changes Made:
‚úÖ Updated player tile to use `debt_amount`:
```javascript
Debt: ‚Ç©${Number(player.debt_amount).toLocaleString()}
```

‚úÖ Added gender code conversion:
```javascript
const genderText = player.gender === 'M' ? 'Male' : 
                  (player.gender === 'F' ? 'Female' : player.gender);
```

## üìä Database Schema Reference

### Actual Column Names:
```sql
player_id           INT(11)
player_number       VARCHAR(3)
name                VARCHAR(100)
age                 INT(11)
gender              ENUM('M','F','Other')        -- Note: M/F not Male/Female
status              ENUM('alive','eliminated','winner')
debt_amount         DECIMAL(15,2)                -- Note: debt_amount not debt
nationality         VARCHAR(50)
registration_date   DATETIME
alliance_group      INT(11)
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Tests

### Test 1: Basic Search
```bash
curl "http://localhost/SquidSphere/api/search_players.php?limit=5"
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Returns 5 players with correct data

### Test 2: Status Filter
```
Status: alive
```
**SQL Generated**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players WHERE status = 'alive' 
ORDER BY player_number ASC LIMIT 100
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Shows alive players only

### Test 3: Gender Filter
```
Gender: Male (value: M)
```
**SQL Generated**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players WHERE gender = 'M' 
ORDER BY player_number ASC LIMIT 100
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Shows male players only

### Test 4: Debt Range
```
Min Debt: 10000000
Max Debt: 50000000
```
**SQL Generated**:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players 
WHERE debt_amount >= 10000000 AND debt_amount <= 50000000
ORDER BY player_number ASC LIMIT 100
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Shows players in debt range

### Test 5: Advanced Query - Above Average Debt
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players 
WHERE player_id IN (
    SELECT player_id FROM players 
    WHERE debt_amount > (SELECT AVG(debt_amount) FROM players)
)
ORDER BY player_number ASC LIMIT 100
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ Shows players with above-average debt

## üéØ What's Working Now

### Basic Filters:
‚úÖ Player Number (LIKE pattern)  
‚úÖ Name (LIKE pattern)  
‚úÖ Gender (M/F/Other)  
‚úÖ Age Range (min/max)  
‚úÖ Nationality (LIKE pattern)  
‚úÖ Debt Range (min/max) - **FIXED**  
‚úÖ Status (alive/eliminated)  

### Advanced Queries:
‚úÖ Above/Below Average Debt - **FIXED**  
‚úÖ Maximum/Minimum Debt - **FIXED**  
‚úÖ Above/Below Average Age  
‚úÖ UNION: Males OR High Debt Females - **FIXED**  
‚úÖ INTERSECT: Young AND Low Debt - **FIXED**  
‚úÖ MINUS: Alive but NOT Young  
‚úÖ IN: Top 3 Nationalities  
‚úÖ NOT IN: Rare Nationalities  
‚úÖ EXISTS: Similar Debt - **FIXED**  

### Sorting:
‚úÖ Player Number (ASC/DESC)  
‚úÖ Name (A-Z / Z-A)  
‚úÖ Age (Youngest/Oldest)  
‚úÖ Debt (Lowest/Highest) - **FIXED**  
‚úÖ Nationality (A-Z)  

### Display:
‚úÖ Player tiles showing correct data  
‚úÖ Debt amount formatted with ‚Ç© symbol  
‚úÖ Gender displayed as Male/Female/Other (converted from M/F)  
‚úÖ Eliminated players with reduced opacity  
‚úÖ SQL query visualization

## üéì SQL Corrections Summary

### Pattern of Fixes:
```sql
-- BEFORE (Wrong)
WHERE debt > 30000000
WHERE debt < (SELECT AVG(debt) FROM players)
WHERE gender = 'Male'
ORDER BY debt DESC

-- AFTER (Correct)
WHERE debt_amount > 30000000
WHERE debt_amount < (SELECT AVG(debt_amount) FROM players)
WHERE gender = 'M'
ORDER BY debt_amount DESC
```

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Open Search Page:
```
http://localhost/SquidSphere/search.php
```

### 2. Click "Search Players" (no filters):
- Should show 100 players
- Should display debt amounts
- Should show gender as Male/Female/Other

### 3. Test Gender Filter:
- Select Gender: Male
- Click Search
- Should show only male players

### 4. Test Debt Range:
- Min Debt: 5000000
- Max Debt: 15000000
- Click Search
- Should show players with debt in that range

### 5. Test Advanced Query:
- Select: "Above Average Debt"
- Click Search
- Should show players with debt higher than average

### 6. Check SQL Query:
- Scroll down to see SQL query display
- Verify it shows `debt_amount` not `debt`
- Verify it shows `gender = 'M'` not `gender = 'Male'`

## üí° Key Learnings

### Always Check Database Schema First!
Before writing queries, run:
```sql
DESCRIBE table_name;
```

### Our Case:
```bash
C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root squid -e "DESCRIBE players;"
```

This revealed:
- Column is `debt_amount` not `debt`
- Gender is ENUM('M','F','Other') not ('Male','Female')

---

## üìù Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `api/search_players.php` - Fixed all SQL queries
2. ‚úÖ `search.php` - Fixed dropdown values and sort options
3. ‚úÖ `search.js` - Fixed display of debt_amount and gender conversion

## üéâ Current Status

**API**: ‚úÖ Returning correct data  
**Frontend**: ‚úÖ Displaying correctly

**Advanced Queries**: ‚úÖ All functional  
**Sort**: ‚úÖ All options working  
**Gender**: ‚úÖ M/F/Other correctly handled
