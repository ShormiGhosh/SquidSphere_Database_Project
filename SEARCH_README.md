3. Select sort order
4. Click "🔍 Search Players"
5. View results in tile format
6. Check the SQL query used for educational purposes

## 📚 Features

### Basic Filters
✅ **Player Number** - LIKE pattern matching (`001`, `%5%`)  
✅ **Name** - LIKE pattern matching (`Seong%`, `%Ali%`)  
✅ **Gender** - Exact match (Male/Female)  
✅ **Age Range** - Min/Max values  
✅ **Nationality** - LIKE pattern matching (`%Korea%`)  
✅ **Debt Range** - Min/Max values  
✅ **Status** - Exact match (alive/eliminated)  

### Advanced Queries

#### Subqueries (IN, NOT IN)
- Above Average Debt
- Below Average Debt
- Above Average Age
- Below Average Age

#### Nested Subqueries
- Maximum Debt (2-level nested)
- Minimum Debt (2-level nested)

#### Set Operations
- **UNION**: Males OR High Debt Females (>50M)
- **INTERSECT**: Young (<30) AND Low Debt (<10M) [simulated]
- **MINUS**: Alive but NOT Young (<25) [simulated]

#### Complex Conditions
- **IN**: Top 3 Nationalities (Most Players)
- **NOT IN**: Rare Nationalities (<5 Players)
- **EXISTS**: Players with Similar Debt (±5M) - Correlated subquery

### Sorting Options
- Player Number (ASC/DESC)
- Name (A-Z / Z-A)
- Age (Youngest/Oldest First)
- Debt (Lowest/Highest First)
- Nationality (A-Z)

### Result Limiting
- Configurable limit (default: 100)
- Prevents overwhelming result sets
- Improves performance

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
search.php              - Main search page (UI)
search.css              - Search panel styling
search.js               - Client-side functionality
api/search_players.php  - Backend SQL query handler
```

### Backend Architecture
```php
buildAdvancedQuery()      → Routes to specific query type
buildBaseQuery()          → Constructs SELECT with filters
buildWhereConditions()    → Builds WHERE clause dynamically
```

### Query Flow
```
User Input → JavaScript → API Request → PHP Backend → MySQL Query → JSON Response → Display Results
```

## 📖 SQL Concepts Demonstrated

### Lab 05 Focus: Subqueries & Set Operations

#### 1. Simple Subqueries
```sql
WHERE player_id IN (SELECT player_id FROM players WHERE debt > ...)
```

#### 2. Nested Subqueries
```sql
WHERE debt = (SELECT MAX(debt) FROM players WHERE player_id IN (...))
```

#### 3. Correlated Subqueries
```sql
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM players p2 WHERE p2.player_id != p1.player_id AND ...)
```

#### 4. Set Operations
```sql
(SELECT * FROM players WHERE ...) UNION (SELECT * FROM players WHERE ...)
```

#### 5. Subqueries with Aggregates
```sql
WHERE debt > (SELECT AVG(debt) FROM players)
```

### Additional SQL Features
- DISTINCT (unique results)
- LIKE (pattern matching with %)
- BETWEEN (range queries)
- IN / NOT IN (membership tests)
- EXISTS (existence tests)
- GROUP BY (data grouping)
- HAVING (filtered grouping)
- ORDER BY (sorting)
- LIMIT (result limiting)
- Aggregate Functions (AVG, MAX, MIN, COUNT)

## 🎯 Example Queries

### Find Korean Players with High Debt
**Filters:**
- Nationality: `%Korea%`
- Debt Min: `50000000`
- Advanced: "Above Average Debt"
- Sort: "Debt (Highest First)"

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players 
WHERE nationality LIKE '%Korea%' 
  AND debt >= 50000000
  AND player_id IN (
      SELECT player_id FROM players 
      WHERE debt > (SELECT AVG(debt) FROM players)
  )
ORDER BY debt DESC 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Young Survivors with Low Debt
**Filters:**
- Status: `alive`
- Advanced: "INTERSECT: Young (<30) AND Low Debt (<10M)"
- Sort: "Age (Youngest First)"

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players 
WHERE status = 'alive'
  AND player_id IN (SELECT player_id FROM players WHERE age < 30)
  AND player_id IN (SELECT player_id FROM players WHERE debt < 10000000)
ORDER BY age ASC 
LIMIT 100;
```

### Players from Major Nationalities
**Filters:**
- Advanced: "IN: Top 3 Nationalities"
- Sort: "Nationality (A-Z)"

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM players 
WHERE nationality IN (
    SELECT nationality FROM players 
    GROUP BY nationality 
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC 
    LIMIT 3
)
ORDER BY nationality ASC 
LIMIT 100;
```
